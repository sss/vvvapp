Welcome to VVV, VVV is an application that catalogs the content of removable
volumes like CD and DVD disks for off-line searching.
Folders and files can also be arranged in a single, virtual file system.
Each folder of this virtual file system can contain files from many disks
so you can arrange your data in a simple and logical way.

Installation:
-------------

VVV does not need to be installed. Everything it needs is contained in its folder.
Just expand the archive in a suitable folder and execute "vvv".

The help file contains some instructions.
