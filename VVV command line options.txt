It is possible to pass the name of a catalog file to the command line.

It is also possible to use some command line options. The available command line options are the following:

options to use the program as a portable app
--------------------------------------------

-s <file name>
   specifies the name of a file used to store the program's settings. Used to make VVV a portable app.
   Note that it is a full file name, not a path to a folder. The file name can be relative to the exe's folder or absolute.

   So for example you can use the following command lines:

   vvv -s "..\Data\Settings\VVV Settings File.txt"
   vvv -s:"..\Data\Settings\VVV Settings File.txt"
   vvv -s"..\Data\Settings\VVV Settings File.txt"

-d <folder name>
   specifies the default folder when creating a new catalog. Used to make VVV a portable app. If relative it is relative to the exe location.

   
options to use the program from the command line
------------------------------------------------

These options are used to run the program from the command line instead of running it as a GUI application.
They can be used to update volumes from command lines.

-v <volume name>
   specifies a volume name to be processed. <volume name> is a string.
   
-vp <volume path>
   specifies the path of the volume to be processed in the file system. If relative it is relative to the exe location.
   
-u
   update the volume. This switch causes VVV tu run in command line mode instead of showing a GUI.
   When using this switch you always need to pass a catalog name and a volume path in the command line.
   The program will not reopen the last used catalog, since it might change.
   
So to update a volume in batch mode you must use both the three switches above and supply a catalog name. For example:

vvv -u -v:"Ever changing volume" -vp:"D:\" "C:\Catalogs\MyCatalog.vvv"
